**Analyze-plasmidsaurus** is a python script developed by the [Mitra Lab](https://mitralab.wustl.edu/) to annotate mutations in plasmidsaurus GenBank files. 

This script takes a reference sequence in file GenBank format and plasmidsaurus file  in GenBank format and conducts a global alignment between the two sequences. Differences between the two sequences are tracked and the type of sequence mutation is added as a annotation to the plasmidsaurus Genbank file.
